Tool Resource Prediction for Genomic Datasets

Question:
- mention in report: could we do experiments to initialize jobs with our predicted memory and see what the success rate is?

TODO:
- add link to valid data in README
- put in README how CSViewer can be used
- add link to report in README
- why not use neural networks? Not many features and there are tools with low number of samples. Our data is not complicated. would be overkill
	--> something for the future?
- prediction intervals only work if tree is big enough --> how big?

Infos:
- write report 20-30 pages
- presentation: 15-20 mins

group tools that have different version or make a distinction between them?
Is there a big variance between versions for a specific tool? Do an analysis on that and find out
